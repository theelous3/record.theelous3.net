What will I have at the end of this tutorial?
You will have a Foundry server running on a remote system that will always be on. You&rsquo;ll have secure HTTPS for your connection. It will be a very basic setup. Your certificate will optionally be self-signed and probably scary looking the first time you connect, but perfectly good to use for years (Step 8a). Alternatively, if you have a domain, we can set up a proper HTTPS site that will get rid of the self signing warning (Step 8b)."><meta name=author content="theelous3"><link rel=canonical href=https://record.theelous3.net/posts/foundry_basic_guide/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.588dd3c94c44990f8e9d54538f82459643520bfe13f1dd1755610419f0e36089.css integrity="sha256-WI3TyUxEmQ+OnVRTj4JFlkNSC/4T8d0XVWEEGfDjYIk=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://record.theelous3.net/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://record.theelous3.net/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://record.theelous3.net/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://record.theelous3.net/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://record.theelous3.net/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://record.theelous3.net/posts/foundry_basic_guide/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://record.theelous3.net/posts/foundry_basic_guide/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="theelous3's record"><meta property="og:title" content="How to set up FoundryVTT on a filthy cheap server, for noobs."><meta property="og:description" content="Last updated: 2025/12/05

You will have a Foundry server running on a remote system that will always be on. You’ll have secure HTTPS for your connection. It will be a very basic setup. Your certificate will optionally be self-signed and probably scary looking the first time you connect, but perfectly good to use for years (Step 8a). Alternatively, if you have a domain, we can set up a proper HTTPS site that will get rid of the self signing warning (Step 8b).\nWhat do you need, before we begin? Between $4 and $6 per month A FoundryVTT licence A terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) If you want the fancier setup, a web domain like yourdomain.com - not required. Step one - Open your terminal Windows: Hit the Windows key and search for PowerShell. Run it. macOS: Hit Command + Space and search for Terminal. Run it.\nNice and easy :)\nStep two - generate ssh keys We need to generate a key pair to securely access the server.\nIn your terminal, type:\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519\rUse the default options for everything, and no password.\nThat generated two files. id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub\nIt tells you their output location. They are either in your drive’s main .ssh folder, or your user’s .ssh folder. If you so wish you can go and rename them something like foundryserverkey and foundryserverkey.pub. I will just keep calling them by their default names here.\nNice job so far! :)\nStep three - get a server You’re going to buy a Virtual Private Server (VPS). This is a virtual machine with some bells and whistles that lives remotely in a datacenter.\nFor this guide I’m going to show you how to do it with a low effort DigitalOcean droplet, a type of VPS. Personally I use a Hetzner server, as they are cheaper and offer a bit more. The downside is that for some countries / types of server they require a scan of an ID before they allow you to start renting a server.\nIf you want to go the Hetzner route to save some money, the entire guide still applies aside from the details around the DigitalOcean UI. Hetzner UI has close equivalents ofc.\nSign up and buy a basic droplet from DigitalOcean here: https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/\nOnce your payment is completed, you’ll find yourself on the https://cloud.digitalocean.com dashboard.\nBack on the DigitalOcean dashboard, on the left under Manage, click Droplets and Create new droplet.\nYou may want to change your server’s location closer to home.\nUnder Authentication you want to select SSH Keys. Choose New SSH Key.\nOpen the id_ed25519.pub file in notepad and copy the contents, it looks like ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza[...].\nPaste the key you copied into the SSH Key Content box. Give it a name, like fvtt or something, and click Add SSH Key.\nUnder Choose a hostname, just call it whatever you like. I’ll call mine FVTT.\nNow at the bottom, you can hit Create Droplet :)\nYou’ll be brought to a new page, where a progress bar will show you your new VPS spinning up! Woo!\nOnce it’s ready to go, copy the IP address (format of x.x.x.x).\nStep four - login to your VPS Go back to your terminal window (PowerShell or Terminal).\nType the following, replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address you just copied:\n$ ssh root@x.x.x.x\rYou’ll get some message that the host key isn’t cached. That is fine, type yes or y and hit enter. Happens on first connect.\nOnce we hit enter, we’ll find ourselves logged in!\nStep five - create yourself a user on the server Lines that start with a $ are commands. Enter them without the $ or leading space. This is true for the rest of the guide. If you see $ lol you should type lol into the terminal and press enter :)\nYou can paste into the terminal window with just a right click.\nAdd a user. I’m foundryuser, so I’ll add myself:\n$ adduser foundryuser\rYou’ll be prompted to enter a password and a bunch of rubbish info. Add a password and just spam enter through the junk.\nNow we give this user a way to do admin things - aka sudo:\n$ usermod -aG sudo foundryuser\rIf you have an issue with rsync run\n$ sudo apt install rsync\rNow we need to set it such that our new user can log in to the server:\n$ rsync --archive --chown=foundryuser:foundryuser ~/.ssh /home/foundryuser\r(Being careful to replace foundryuser with your username.)\nNow log out (type exit), and log back in, using your new username instead of root.\n$ ssh foundryuser@x.x.x.x\rTest this user is working with this command, entering this new user’s password when prompted:\n$ sudo ls -la /root\rIf you see some random files listed, nice!\nUpdate the server:\n$ sudo apt update\r$ sudo apt upgrade -y\rAccept the default on anything that pops up.\nIf you have any issues, relog as root and make sure you didn’t miss a step.\nStep six - set up stuff Foundry needs I’m going to deviate a little from the actual Foundry guide, as I find this more repeatable, simpler, and with a much better troubleshooting story.\nInstall nvm. Foundry runs on node, a type of JavaScript. We’re going to install the Node Version Manager to handle all of the Node stuff for us.\nGo here and get the correct install URL: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating\nIt will look like this:\n$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash\rThen:\n$ source ~/.bashrc\rEnsure nvm is installed:\n$ command -v nvm\r…should output nvm.\nInstall a modern version of Node. Generally you want to install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release. Run this command to get a list of available node versions:\n$ nvm ls-remote\rYou will be presented with a list of versions. Go for the latest LTS release. In my EXAMPLE screenshot (which may be out of date!) that version is 24.11.1\n$ nvm install 24.11.1\rEnsure node is installed:\n$ node --version\r…will output the version.\nStep seven - create directories for Foundry, and install it $ cd ~ \u0026\u0026 mkdir foundryvtt \u0026\u0026 mkdir foundrydata \u0026\u0026 cd foundryvtt\rNow, log in to the Foundry site, go to your user profile -\u003e purchased licences. Select the latest stable release from the dropdown, and the “node.js” version for “operating system”.\nThen use the “TIMED URL” download link copy button.\nBack in the terminal:\nReplace the PASTE_IN_HERE portion with your copied link, leaving in the quotes '!\n$ curl -o foundryvtt.zip 'PASTE_IN_HERE'\rIt will look like:\n$ curl -o foundryvtt.zip 'https://r2.foundryvtt.com/releases/13.351/FoundryVTT-Node-13.351.zip?verify=1764763601-oudNyhbcXSfJoCL%2BkWtdRPJ2Wdx9fRG9429%2B%2FPAaIR4%3D'\rThen unzip:\n$ unzip foundryvtt.zip\rIf you get an error that you do not have unzip, run\n$ sudo apt install unzip\rand try unzip again :)\nStep eight - check Foundry is working Replace username and run:\nWARNING! DO NOT ENTER YOUR LICENSE KEY YET\n$ node ~/foundryvtt/main.js --dataPath=$HOME/foundrydata\rYou should see Foundry start up :D\nNow you can open a browser and go take a look. In the address bar, paste the server’s IP and set the port to 30000, like:\n178.62.98.216:30000\rKill Foundry with ctrl+c in the terminal window once you’re happy it’s working so far.\nStep nine - enable https If you want to ensure your license key is secure when you activate Foundry, and you want to ensure the traffic of your players and yourself are secure from prying eyes (which you should), you’ll want to enable HTTPS.\nThis means we’re going to generate some more keys! Yaaaaaaaay.\nThis is where the guide takes two paths - choose your own adventure.\nOptions:\nOption A: You don’t have a domain name. Use a self-signed cert. It’s free, easy, but gives a browser warning. Option B: You own or are going right now to buy a domain name (like yourdomain.com). Use Let’s Encrypt. It’s free, slightly more setup, and gives a proper https connection. We are going to set this version up behind a dedicated webserver for a more complete “best practice” path. Option nine(a): Self-Signed (No Domain) Install openssl:\n$ sudo apt install openssl\rSet up the directory structure:\n$ cd ~ \u0026\u0026 mkdir foundrycerts \u0026\u0026 cd foundrycerts\rGenerate cert/key (this is a long command be sure to copy it all!):\n$ openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 99999\rSpam enter to skip junk questions.\nNow we need to tell Foundry where these files are. Skip down to “Configuring Foundry” below.\nVIM WARNING!!! A quick lesson in vim, the text editor you’ll need next! The next section “Configuring Foundry” has tips for using vim around a direct example. If you are going to use option nine(b) for high tech HTTPS and you don’t know how to use vim, look ahead at the example. If you are going straight to that section, Go right ahead, and take your time :)\nOption nine(b): Let’s Encrypt (Requires Domain, more complex) This option gives you proper HTTPS, no browser warnings, and auto-renewing certificates.\nFirst, go to your domain registrar (where you bought your domain) and create a DNS A Record.\nThat might sound terrifying but once you click on your domain in your account, there will be a pretty clear DNS settings / records option there somewhere. You are just going to “add record” and:\nHost: @ or leave blank (or a subdomain like foundry) Value: Your server’s IP address (x.x.x.x) I recommend a subdomain. If you type “foundry” in host your url will ultimately be like foundry.yourdomain.com which is nice.\nWait a few minutes for this DNS change to update. It should have a little pending warning or whatever on the record page.\nBack in your terminal, install certbot, nginx (a webserver) and some helper scripts:\n$ sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx\rOnce these are installed, we’ll create a config in the server so it knows about foundry:\n$ sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/foundry\rThis opens vim - please read the “VIM WARNING” if you have not, and you aren’t familiar with vim!\nPaste this in to vim (typically right click pastes in terminals):\nserver { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name yourdomain.com; # or foundry.yourdomain.com location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:30000/; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\"; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } Save and exit esc -\u003e :wq\nEnable the site config\n$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/foundry /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\r$ sudo nginx -t\r$ sudo systemctl restart nginx\rGenerate the certificate (replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain. If you set your A record earlier to be a subdomain like foundry.yourdomain.com be sure to use that full domain.):\n$ sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com\rConfiguring Foundry (For both nine(a) and nine(b)) This bit is a little tricky. We’re going to use vim to edit the config file, so Foundry knows where to find our cert file.\nvim is an old-school editor, and tricky for noobs. If you follow the keystrokes I lay out exactly you won’t have a problem. If at any point you do have a problem, press esc followed by : followed by q! and press enter to exit, and just start again. esc enters command mode and :q! is the command that means “quit without caring if it’s not saved”.\n$ vim ~/foundrydata/Config/options.json\rOnce vim is open, press i. You will see at the bottom it says -- INSERT --. This is good. If it does not, you did not press i.\nReplace foundryuser as per usual.\nUse the arrow keys to navigate.\nIf you are self signing, make these changes:\n\"sslCert\": \"/home/foundryuser/foundrycerts/cert.pem\",\r\"sslKey\": \"/home/foundryuser/foundrycerts/key.pem\",\rIf you are using a domain and let’s encrypt, only set:\n\"proxySSL\": true,\rleaving the other ssl fields as they are.\nNow press esc then : then type wq and hit enter.\nYou can verify everything worked by running Foundry again with:\n$ node ~/foundryvtt/main.js --dataPath=$HOME/foundrydata\rIf you self signed you should now see both the cert and key have paths in the startup text of Foundry.\nLet’s encrypt doesn’t need certs there.\nKill Foundry again with ctrl+c.\nStep ten - create a service to run Foundry for you When you close your server connection, processes you have running close too. We want to create a service to keep Foundry running even when we close our connection to the server.\nGet your Node version and make a note of it. You’ll need it in a second:\n$ node --version\rFirst we’re going to use vim to create a service file:\n$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/foundry.service\rPress i again to go into INSERT mode and type the following (you can try pasting it in but vim is kind of weird like that):\nOf course, again replace foundryuser with your username in all four locations. Also, replace your Node version. Below, mine is v24.x.x in the ExecStart line.\n[Unit] Description=FoundryVTT After=network.target StartLimitIntervalSec=0 [Service] Type=simple Restart=always RestartSec=1 User=foundryuser WorkingDirectory=/home/foundryuser/foundryvtt ExecStart=/home/foundryuser/.nvm/versions/node/v24.x.x/bin/node main.js --dataPath=/home/foundryuser/foundrydata [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Exit vim as before: esc, :, wq, enter.\nNow start the service:\n$ sudo systemctl start foundry.service\rCheck it’s up and running. Press q to exit the status:\n$ sudo systemctl status foundry.service\rFinally, enable the service so it auto starts any time the server is rebooted:\n$ sudo systemctl enable foundry.service\raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that’s it! Congrats on making it through!\nStep eleven - using the server You are ready to adventure!\nImportant!\nIf you used Option nine(a) (Self-Signed): You’re going to get a weird looking warning the first time you connect. This is because your server is issuing your browser with its own self-signed certificate (the one you made for it). Just go to advanced and accept it and continue. We’re not really interested in if it is authentic, because you know it is, you just made it.\nTo connect to your server, go to the following address (replace 0.0.0.0 with your server’s IP address):\nhttps://0.0.0.0:30000\rIf you used Option nine(b) (Let’s Encrypt): You can navigate directly to your domain. No warnings! And no need to use a port number.\nhttps://yourdomain.com\rNow you can enter your licence key and start using your server. I recommend using cyberduck as an ftp (remote file) gui. You can reuse the keys you generated for your ssh connection in there. It makes it so you can drag and drop files between the server and your computer.\nhttps://cyberduck.io/\nLike this guide?

You&rsquo;ll have secure HTTPS for your connection. It will be a very basic setup. Your certificate will optionally be self-signed and probably scary looking the first time you connect, but perfectly good to use for years (Step 8a). Alternatively, if you have a domain, we can set up a proper HTTPS site that will get rid of the self signing warning (Step 8b).</p><h4 id=what-do-you-need-before-we-begin>What do you need, before we begin?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-do-you-need-before-we-begin>#</a></h4><ul><li>Between $4 and $6 per month</li><li>A FoundryVTT licence</li><li>A terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux)</li><li>If you want the fancier setup, a web domain like <code>yourdomain.com</code> - not required.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=step-one---open-your-terminal>Step one - Open your terminal<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-one---open-your-terminal>#</a></h3><p><strong>Windows:</strong> Hit the Windows key and search for <code>PowerShell</code>. Run it.
<strong>macOS:</strong> Hit Command + Space and search for <code>Terminal</code>. Run it.</p><p>Nice and easy :)</p><hr><h3 id=step-two---generate-ssh-keys>Step two - generate ssh keys<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-two---generate-ssh-keys>#</a></h3><p>We need to generate a key pair to securely access the server.</p><p>In your terminal, type:</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
</code></pre><p>Use the default options for everything, and no password.</p><p>That generated two files. <code>id_ed25519</code> and <code>id_ed25519.pub</code></p><p>It tells you their output location. They are either in your drive&rsquo;s main <code>.ssh</code> folder, or your user&rsquo;s <code>.ssh</code> folder. If you so wish you can go and rename them something like <code>foundryserverkey</code> and <code>foundryserverkey.pub</code>. I will just keep calling them by their default names here.</p><p>Nice job so far! :)</p><hr><h3 id=step-three---get-a-server>Step three - get a server<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-three---get-a-server>#</a></h3><p>You’re going to buy a Virtual Private Server (VPS). This is a virtual machine with some bells and whistles that lives remotely in a datacenter.</p><p>For this guide I’m going to show you how to do it with a low effort DigitalOcean droplet, a type of VPS. Personally I use a Hetzner server, as they are cheaper and offer a bit more. The downside is that for some countries / types of server they require a scan of an ID before they allow you to start renting a server.</p><p>If you want to go the Hetzner route to save some money, the entire guide still applies aside from the details around the DigitalOcean UI. Hetzner UI has close equivalents ofc.</p><p>Sign up and buy a basic droplet from DigitalOcean here:
<a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/>https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/</a></p><p>Once your payment is completed, you’ll find yourself on the <a href=https://cloud.digitalocean.com>https://cloud.digitalocean.com</a> dashboard.</p><p>Back on the DigitalOcean dashboard, on the left under <strong>Manage</strong>, click <code>Droplets</code> and <code>Create new droplet</code>.</p><p>You may want to change your server’s location closer to home.</p><p>Under <strong>Authentication</strong> you want to select <code>SSH Keys</code>. Choose <code>New SSH Key</code>.</p><p>Open the <code>id_ed25519.pub</code> file in notepad and copy the contents, it looks like <code>ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza[...]</code>.</p><p>Paste the key you copied into the <code>SSH Key Content</code> box. Give it a name, like <code>fvtt</code> or something, and click <code>Add SSH Key</code>.</p><p>Under <code>Choose a hostname</code>, just call it whatever you like. I’ll call mine <code>FVTT</code>.</p><p>Now at the bottom, you can hit <code>Create Droplet</code> :)</p><p>You’ll be brought to a new page, where a progress bar will show you your new VPS spinning up! Woo!</p><p>Once it’s ready to go, copy the IP address (format of <code>x.x.x.x</code>).</p><hr><h3 id=step-four---login-to-your-vps>Step four - login to your VPS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-four---login-to-your-vps>#</a></h3><p>Go back to your terminal window (PowerShell or Terminal).</p><p>Type the following, replacing <code>x.x.x.x</code> with the IP address you just copied:</p><pre><code>$ ssh root@x.x.x.x
</code></pre><p>You’ll get some message that the host key isn’t cached. That is fine, type <code>yes</code> or <code>y</code> and hit enter. Happens on first connect.</p><p>Once we hit enter, we’ll find ourselves logged in!</p><hr><h3 id=step-five---create-yourself-a-user-on-the-server>Step five - create yourself a user on the server<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-five---create-yourself-a-user-on-the-server>#</a></h3><p>Lines that start with a <code>$</code> are commands. Enter them <strong>without</strong> the <code>$</code> or leading space. This is true for the rest of the guide. If you see <code>$ lol</code> you should type <code>lol</code> into the terminal and press <code>enter</code> :)</p><p>You can paste into the terminal window with just a right click.</p><p>Add a user. I’m <code>foundryuser</code>, so I’ll add myself:</p><pre><code>$ adduser foundryuser
</code></pre><p>You’ll be prompted to enter a password and a bunch of rubbish info. Add a password and just spam <code>enter</code> through the junk.</p><p>Now we give this user a way to do admin things - aka <code>sudo</code>:</p><pre><code>$ usermod -aG sudo foundryuser
</code></pre><p>If you have an issue with rsync run</p><pre><code>$ sudo apt install rsync
</code></pre><p>Now we need to set it such that our new user can log in to the server:</p><pre><code>$ rsync --archive --chown=foundryuser:foundryuser ~/.ssh /home/foundryuser
</code></pre><p>(Being careful to replace <code>foundryuser</code> with your username.)</p><p>Now log out (type <code>exit</code>), and log back in, using your new username instead of <code>root</code>.</p><pre><code>$ ssh foundryuser@x.x.x.x
</code></pre><p>Test this user is working with this command, entering this new user’s password when prompted:</p><pre><code>$ sudo ls -la /root
</code></pre><p>If you see some random files listed, nice!</p><p>Update the server:</p><pre><code>$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade -y
</code></pre><p>Accept the default on anything that pops up.</p><p>If you have any issues, relog as <code>root</code> and make sure you didn’t miss a step.</p><hr><h3 id=step-six---set-up-stuff-foundry-needs>Step six - set up stuff Foundry needs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-six---set-up-stuff-foundry-needs>#</a></h3><p>I’m going to deviate a little from the actual Foundry guide, as I find this more repeatable, simpler, and with a much better troubleshooting story.</p><p>Install <code>nvm</code>. Foundry runs on <code>node</code>, a type of JavaScript. We’re going to install the Node Version Manager to handle all of the Node stuff for us.</p><p>Go here and get the correct install URL:
<a href=https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating>https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating</a></p><p>It will look like this:</p><pre><code>$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
</code></pre><p>Then:</p><pre><code>$ source ~/.bashrc
</code></pre><p>Ensure <code>nvm</code> is installed:</p><pre><code>$ command -v nvm
</code></pre><p>…should output <code>nvm</code>.</p><p>Install a modern version of Node. Generally you want to install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release. Run this command to get a list of available node versions:</p><pre><code>$ nvm ls-remote
</code></pre><p>You will be presented with a list of versions. Go for the latest LTS release. In my EXAMPLE screenshot (which may be out of date!) that version is <code>24.11.1</code></p><pre><code>$ nvm install 24.11.1
</code></pre><p><img alt="latest lts" loading=lazy src=/posts/foundry_basic_guide/latestlts.png></p><p>Ensure node is installed:</p><pre><code>$ node --version

</code></pre><p>Now, log in to the Foundry site, go to your user profile -> purchased licences. Select the latest stable release from the dropdown, and the &ldquo;node.js&rdquo; version for &ldquo;operating system&rdquo;.</p><p><img alt="download link" loading=lazy src=/posts/foundry_basic_guide/timed_link.png></p><p>Then use the &ldquo;TIMED URL&rdquo; download link copy button.</p><p>Back in the terminal:</p><p><strong>Replace the <code>PASTE_IN_HERE</code> portion with your copied link, leaving in the quotes <code>'</code>!</strong></p><pre><code>$ curl -o foundryvtt.zip 'PASTE_IN_HERE'
</code></pre><p>It will look like:</p><pre><code>$ curl -o foundryvtt.zip 'https://r2.foundryvtt.com/releases/13.351/FoundryVTT-Node-13.351.zip?verify=1764763601-oudNyhbcXSfJoCL%2BkWtdRPJ2Wdx9fRG9429%2B%2FPAaIR4%3D'
</code></pre><p>Then unzip:</p><pre><code>$ unzip foundryvtt.zip
</code></pre><p>If you get an error that you do not have unzip, run</p><pre><code>$ sudo apt install unzip
</code></pre><p>and try unzip again :)</p><hr><h3 id=step-eight---check-foundry-is-working>Step eight - check Foundry is working<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-eight---check-foundry-is-working>#</a></h3><p>Replace username and run:</p><p><em>WARNING! DO NOT ENTER YOUR LICENSE KEY YET</em></p><pre><code>$ node ~/foundryvtt/main.js --dataPath=$HOME/foundrydata
</code></pre><p>You should see Foundry start up :D</p><p>Now you can open a browser and go take a look. In the address bar, paste the server’s IP and set the port to 30000, like:</p><pre><code>178.62.98.216:30000

Yaaaaaaaay.</p><p>This is where the guide takes two paths - choose your own adventure.</p><p><strong>Options:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Option A:</strong> You don&rsquo;t have a domain name. Use a self-signed cert. It&rsquo;s free, easy, but gives a browser warning.</li><li><strong>Option B:</strong> You own or are going right now to buy a domain name (like <code>yourdomain.com</code>). Use Let&rsquo;s Encrypt. It&rsquo;s free, slightly more setup, and gives a proper https connection. We are going to set this version up behind a dedicated webserver for a more complete &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; path.</li></ul><h3 id=option-ninea-self-signed-no-domain>Option nine(a): Self-Signed (No Domain)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#option-ninea-self-signed-no-domain>#</a></h3><p>Install <code>openssl</code>:</p><pre><code>$ sudo apt install openssl
</code></pre><p>Set up the directory structure:</p><pre><code>$ cd ~ &amp;&amp; mkdir foundrycerts &amp;&amp; cd foundrycerts
</code></pre><p>Generate cert/key (this is a long command be sure to copy it all!):</p><pre><code>$ openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 99999
</code></pre><p>Spam <code>enter</code> to skip junk questions.</p><p>Now we need to tell Foundry where these files are. Skip down to &ldquo;Configuring Foundry&rdquo; below.</p><h3 id=vim-warning-a-quick-lesson-in-vim-the-text-editor-youll-need-next>VIM WARNING!!! A quick lesson in vim, the text editor you&rsquo;ll need next!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vim-warning-a-quick-lesson-in-vim-the-text-editor-youll-need-next>#</a></h3><p>The next section &ldquo;Configuring Foundry&rdquo; has tips for using vim around a direct example. If you are going to use option nine(b) for high tech HTTPS and you don&rsquo;t know how to use vim, look ahead at the example. If you are going straight to that section, Go right ahead, and take your time :)</p><h3 id=option-nineb-lets-encrypt-requires-domain-more-complex>Option nine(b): Let&rsquo;s Encrypt (Requires Domain, more complex)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#option-nineb-lets-encrypt-requires-domain-more-complex>#</a></h3><p>This option gives you proper HTTPS, no browser warnings, and auto-renewing certificates.</p><p>First, go to your domain registrar (where you bought your domain) and create a <strong>DNS A Record</strong>.</p><p>That might sound terrifying but once you click on your domain in your account, there will be a pretty clear DNS settings / records option there somewhere. You are just going to &ldquo;add record&rdquo; and:</p><ul><li><strong>Host:</strong> <code>@</code> or leave blank (or a subdomain like <code>foundry</code>)</li><li><strong>Value:</strong> Your server&rsquo;s IP address (<code>x.x.x.x</code>)</li></ul><p>I recommend a subdomain. If you type &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; in <code>host</code> your url will ultimately be like <code>foundry.yourdomain.com</code> which is nice.</p><p>Wait a few minutes for this DNS change to update. It should have a little pending warning or whatever on the record page.</p><p>Back in your terminal, install certbot, nginx (a webserver) and some helper scripts:</p><pre><code>$ sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
</code></pre><p>Once these are installed, we&rsquo;ll create a config in the server so it knows about foundry:</p><pre><code>$ sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/foundry
</code></pre><p>This opens vim - please read the &ldquo;VIM WARNING&rdquo; if you have not, and you aren&rsquo;t familiar with vim!</p><p>Paste this in to vim (typically right click pastes in terminals):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-nginx data-lang=nginx><span class=line><span class=cl>    <span class=k>server</span> <span class=p>{</span>

Congrats on making it through!</p><hr><h3 id=step-eleven---using-the-server>Step eleven - using the server<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-eleven---using-the-server>#</a></h3><p>You are ready to adventure!</p><p><strong>Important!</strong></p><p><strong>If you used Option nine(a) (Self-Signed):</strong>
You’re going to get a weird looking warning the first time you connect. This is because your server is issuing your browser with its own self-signed certificate (the one you made for it). Just go to advanced and accept it and continue. We’re not really interested in if it is authentic, because you know it is, you just made it.</p><p>To connect to your server, go to the following address (replace <code>0.0.0.0</code> with your server&rsquo;s IP address):</p><pre><code>https://0.0.0.0:30000
</code></pre><p><strong>If you used Option nine(b) (Let&rsquo;s Encrypt):</strong>
You can navigate directly to your domain. No warnings! And no need to use a port number.</p><pre><code>https://yourdomain.com
</code></pre><hr><p>Now you can enter your licence key and start using your server. I recommend using cyberduck as an ftp (remote file) gui. You can reuse the keys you generated for your ssh connection in there. It makes it so you can drag and drop files between the server and your computer.</p><p><a href=https://cyberduck.io/>https://cyberduck.io/</a></p><p>Like this guide?
