Here is a mockup:\nIt is easily made by combining an m5 grub screw with a suitably thin / small disk.\nI turned a 2.7mm x 8.75mm disc, drilled and tapped it for m5, and heavily chamfered the bottom with a 45degree tool for clearance of the shelf in the cutter block. I then welded this to an m5 grub screw. This allows for fine upward height adjustment of the cutter blades in the block for correct setting.\nI think you could skip the chamfer if you used a thinner disk, but it can take considerable force to move the cutter against the friction of the blocking wedge.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need a lathe. Something good enough can be accomplished with a washer and basic tools like a file / epoxy and glue.\nBelow are images from the manual showing the \u0026ldquo;special screw\u0026rdquo; as part 132263 and showing the image where it discusses using them to adjust the blades - this image is terrible.\nSuffice to say the \u0026ldquo;top\u0026rdquo; flat of the disk rides in the ground slot of the blade, lifting it as the grub screw is turned. The grub screw is screwed in from the bottom of the blocking wedge. It is driven from above through a hole in the wedge with a hex key - raising the blade.\n","permalink":"https://record.theelous3.net/posts/dw50_special_screw/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe dewalt dw50, dw55, and dw1150 (and presumably more) machines have an enigmatic \u0026ldquo;special adjusting screw\u0026rdquo; with which you can adjust the height of the blades in the cutter block to the correct height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe specs for these are not available anywhere on the internet.

Absolutely nothing! Wahoo!\nWhat will I have at the end of this tutorial? You will have a Foundry server running on a remote system that will always be on. You\u0026rsquo;ll have secure HTTPS for your connection. It will be a very basic setup. Your certificate will optionally be self-signed and probably scary looking the first time you connect, but perfectly good to use for years (Step nine(a)). Alternatively, if you have a domain, we can set up a proper HTTPS site that will get rid of the self signing warning (Step nine(b)).\nWhat do you need, before we begin? Between $4 and $6 per month A FoundryVTT licence A terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) If you want the fancier setup, a web domain like yourdomain.com - not required. Step one - Open your terminal Windows: Hit the Windows key and search for PowerShell. Run it. macOS: Hit Command + Space and search for Terminal. Run it.\nNice and easy :)\nStep two - generate ssh keys We need to generate a key pair to securely access the server.\nIn your terminal, type:\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519\rUse the default options for everything, and no password.\nThat generated two files. id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub\nIt tells you their output location. They are either in your drive\u0026rsquo;s main .ssh folder, or your user\u0026rsquo;s .ssh folder. If you so wish you can go and rename them something like foundryserverkey and foundryserverkey.pub. I will just keep calling them by their default names here.\nNice job so far! :)\nStep three - get a server You’re going to buy a Virtual Private Server (VPS). This is a virtual machine with some bells and whistles that lives remotely in a datacenter.\nFor this guide I’m going to show you how to do it with a low effort DigitalOcean droplet, a type of VPS. Personally I use a Hetzner server, as they are cheaper and offer a bit more. The downside is that for some countries / types of server they require a scan of an ID before they allow you to start renting a server.\nIf you want to go the Hetzner route to save some money, the entire guide still applies aside from the details around the DigitalOcean UI. Hetzner UI has close equivalents ofc.\nSign up and buy a basic droplet from DigitalOcean here: https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/\nOnce your payment is completed, you’ll find yourself on the https://cloud.digitalocean.com dashboard.\nBack on the DigitalOcean dashboard, on the left under Manage, click Droplets and Create new droplet.\nYou may want to change your server’s location closer to home.\nUnder Authentication you want to select SSH Keys. Choose New SSH Key.\nOpen the id_ed25519.pub file in notepad and copy the contents, it looks like ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza[...].\nPaste the key you copied into the SSH Key Content box. Give it a name, like fvtt or something, and click Add SSH Key.\nUnder Choose a hostname, just call it whatever you like. I’ll call mine FVTT.\nNow at the bottom, you can hit Create Droplet :)\nYou’ll be brought to a new page, where a progress bar will show you your new VPS spinning up! Woo!\nOnce it’s ready to go, copy the IP address (format of x.x.x.x).\nStep four - login to your VPS Go back to your terminal window (PowerShell or Terminal).\nType the following, replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address you just copied:\n$ ssh root@x.x.x.x\rYou’ll get some message that the host key isn’t cached. That is fine, type yes or y and hit enter. Happens on first connect.\nOnce we hit enter, we’ll find ourselves logged in!\nStep five - create yourself a user on the server Lines that start with a $ are commands. Enter them without the $ or leading space. This is true for the rest of the guide. If you see $ lol you should type lol into the terminal and press enter :)\nYou can paste into the terminal window with just a right click.\nAdd a user. I’m foundryuser, so I’ll add myself:\n$ adduser foundryuser\rYou’ll be prompted to enter a password and a bunch of rubbish info. Add a password and just spam enter through the junk.\nNow we give this user a way to do admin things - aka sudo:\n$ usermod -aG sudo foundryuser\rIf you have an issue with rsync run\n$ sudo apt install rsync\rNow we need to set it such that our new user can log in to the server:\n$ rsync --archive --chown=foundryuser:foundryuser ~/.ssh /home/foundryuser\r(Being careful to replace foundryuser with your username.)\nNow log out (type exit), and log back in, using your new username instead of root.\n$ ssh foundryuser@x.x.x.x\rTest this user is working with this command, entering this new user’s password when prompted:\n$ sudo ls -la /root\rIf you see some random files listed, nice!\nUpdate the server:\n$ sudo apt update\r$ sudo apt upgrade -y\rAccept the default on anything that pops up.\nIf you have any issues, relog as root and make sure you didn’t miss a step.\nStep six - set up stuff Foundry needs I’m going to deviate a little from the actual Foundry guide, as I find this more repeatable, simpler, and with a much better troubleshooting story.\nInstall nvm. Foundry runs on node, a type of JavaScript. We’re going to install the Node Version Manager to handle all of the Node stuff for us.\nGo here and get the correct install URL: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating\nIt will look like this:\n$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash\rThen:\n$ source ~/.bashrc\rEnsure nvm is installed:\n$ command -v nvm\r…should output nvm.\nInstall a modern version of Node. Generally you want to install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release. Run this command to get a list of available node versions:\n$ nvm ls-remote\rYou will be presented with a list of versions. Go for the latest LTS release. In my EXAMPLE screenshot (which may be out of date!) that version is 24.11.1\n$ nvm install 24.11.1\rEnsure node is installed:\n$ node --version\r…will output the version.\nStep seven - create directories for Foundry, and install it $ cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir foundryvtt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir foundrydata \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd foundryvtt\rNow, open your web browser and log in to the Foundry site, then go to your user profile -\u0026gt; purchased licences. Select the latest stable release from the dropdown, and the \u0026ldquo;node.js\u0026rdquo; version for \u0026ldquo;operating system\u0026rdquo;.\nThen use the \u0026ldquo;TIMED URL\u0026rdquo; download link copy button.\nBack in the terminal:\nReplace the PASTE_IN_HERE portion with your copied link, leaving in the quotes '!\n$ curl -o foundryvtt.zip 'PASTE_IN_HERE'\rIt will look like:\n$ curl -o foundryvtt.zip 'https://r2.foundryvtt.com/releases/13.351/FoundryVTT-Node-13.351.zip?verify=1764763601-oudNyhbcXSfJoCL%2BkWtdRPJ2Wdx9fRG9429%2B%2FPAaIR4%3D'\rThen unzip:\n$ unzip foundryvtt.zip\rIf you get an error that you do not have unzip, run\n$ sudo apt install unzip\rand try unzip again :)\nStep eight - check Foundry is working Replace username and run:\nWARNING! DO NOT ENTER YOUR LICENSE KEY YET\n$ node ~/foundryvtt/main.js --dataPath=$HOME/foundrydata\rYou should see Foundry start up :D\nNow you can open a browser and go take a look. In the address bar, paste the server’s IP and set the port to 30000, like:\n178.62.98.216:30000\rKill Foundry with ctrl+c in the terminal window once you’re happy it’s working so far.\nStep nine - enable https If you want to ensure your license key is secure when you activate Foundry, and you want to ensure the traffic of your players and yourself are secure from prying eyes (which you should), you’ll want to enable HTTPS.\nThis means we’re going to generate some more keys! Yaaaaaaaay.\nThis is where the guide takes two paths - choose your own adventure.\nOptions:\nOption A: You don\u0026rsquo;t have a domain name. Use a self-signed cert. It\u0026rsquo;s free, easy, but gives a browser warning. Option B: You own or are going right now to buy a domain name (like yourdomain.com). Use Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt. It\u0026rsquo;s free, slightly more setup, and gives a proper https connection. We are going to set this version up behind a dedicated webserver for a more complete \u0026ldquo;best practice\u0026rdquo; path. Option nine(a): Self-Signed (No Domain) Install openssl:\n$ sudo apt install openssl\rSet up the directory structure:\n$ cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir foundrycerts \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd foundrycerts\rGenerate cert/key (this is a long command be sure to copy it all!):\n$ openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 99999\rSpam enter to skip junk questions.\nNow we need to tell Foundry where these files are. Skip down to \u0026ldquo;Configuring Foundry\u0026rdquo; below.\nVIM WARNING!!! A quick lesson in vim, the text editor you\u0026rsquo;ll need next! The section \u0026ldquo;Configuring Foundry\u0026rdquo; has tips for using vim around a direct example. If you are going to use option nine(b) for fancy HTTPS and you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use vim, look ahead at the example. If you are going straight to that section, Go right ahead, and take your time :)\nOption nine(b): Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt (Requires Domain, more complex) This option gives you proper HTTPS, no browser warnings, and auto-renewing certificates.\nFirst, go to your domain registrar (where you bought your domain) and create a DNS A Record.\nThat might sound terrifying but once you click on your domain in your account, there will be a pretty clear DNS settings / records option there somewhere. You are just going to \u0026ldquo;add record\u0026rdquo; and:\nHost: @ or leave blank (or a subdomain like foundry) Value: Your server\u0026rsquo;s IP address (x.x.x.x) I recommend a subdomain. If you type \u0026ldquo;foundry\u0026rdquo; in host your url will ultimately be like foundry.yourdomain.com which is nice.\nBack in your terminal, install certbot, nginx (a webserver) and some helper scripts:\n$ sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx\rOnce these are installed, we\u0026rsquo;ll create a config in the server so it knows about foundry:\n$ sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/foundry\rThis opens vim - please read the \u0026ldquo;VIM WARNING\u0026rdquo; if you have not, and you aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with vim!\nPaste this in to vim (typically right click pastes in terminals):\nserver { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name yourdomain.com; # or foundry.yourdomain.com location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:30000/; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \u0026#34;Upgrade\u0026#34;; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } Save and exit esc -\u0026gt; :wq\nEnable the site config\n$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/foundry /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\r$ sudo nginx -t\r$ sudo systemctl restart nginx\rNow we will check that the DNS records we created have been established - go to this site and put your domain in: https://www.whatsmydns.net/\nAll green? Good to go. If not, just wait a few and check again.\nGenerate the certificate (replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain. If you set your A record earlier to be a subdomain like foundry.yourdomain.com be sure to use that full domain):\n$ sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com\rConfiguring Foundry (For both nine(a) and nine(b)) This bit is a little tricky. We’re going to use vim to edit the config file, so Foundry knows where to find our cert file.\nvim is an old-school editor, and tricky for noobs. If you follow the keystrokes I lay out exactly you won’t have a problem. If at any point you do have a problem, press esc followed by : followed by q! and press enter to exit, and just start again. esc enters command mode and :q! is the command that means \u0026ldquo;quit without caring if it\u0026rsquo;s not saved\u0026rdquo;.\n$ vim ~/foundrydata/Config/options.json\rOnce vim is open, press i. You will see at the bottom it says -- INSERT --. This is good. If it does not, you either did not press i, or you can press esc and then i.\nReplace foundryuser with your own as per usual.\nUse the arrow keys to navigate.\nIf you are self signing, make these changes:\n\u0026quot;sslCert\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/home/foundryuser/foundrycerts/cert.pem\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;sslKey\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/home/foundryuser/foundrycerts/key.pem\u0026quot;,\rIf you are using a domain and let\u0026rsquo;s encrypt, only set:\n\u0026quot;proxySSL\u0026quot;: true,\rleaving the other fields as they are.\nNow press esc then type :wq and hit enter.\nYou can verify everything worked by running Foundry again with:\n$ node ~/foundryvtt/main.js --dataPath=$HOME/foundrydata\rIf you self signed you should now see both the cert and key have paths in the startup text of Foundry.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s encrypt doesn\u0026rsquo;t need certs there.\nKill Foundry again with ctrl+c.\nStep ten - create a service to run Foundry for you When you close your server connection, processes you have running close too. We want to create a service to keep Foundry running even when we close our connection to the server.\nGet your Node version and make a note of it. You’ll need it in a second:\n$ node --version\rFirst we’re going to use vim to create a service file:\n$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/foundry.service\rPress i again to go into INSERT mode and type the following (you can try pasting it in but vim is kind of weird like that):\nOf course, again replace foundryuser with your username in all four locations. Also, replace your Node version. Below, mine is v24.x.x in the ExecStart line.\n[Unit] Description=FoundryVTT After=network.target StartLimitIntervalSec=0 [Service] Type=simple Restart=always RestartSec=1 User=foundryuser WorkingDirectory=/home/foundryuser/foundryvtt ExecStart=/home/foundryuser/.nvm/versions/node/v24.x.x/bin/node main.js --dataPath=/home/foundryuser/foundrydata [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Exit vim as before: esc, :, wq, enter.\nNow start the service:\n$ sudo systemctl start foundry.service\rCheck it’s up and running. Press q to exit the status:\n$ sudo systemctl status foundry.service\rFinally, enable the service so it auto starts any time the server is rebooted:\n$ sudo systemctl enable foundry.service\raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that’s it! Congrats on making it through!\nStep eleven - using the server You are ready to adventure!\nImportant!\nIf you used Option nine(a) (Self-Signed): You’re going to get a weird looking warning the first time you connect. This is because your server is issuing your browser with its own self-signed certificate (the one you made for it). Just go to advanced and accept it and continue. We’re not really interested in if it is authentic, because you know it is, you just made it.\nTo connect to your server, go to the following address (replace 0.0.0.0 with your server\u0026rsquo;s IP address):\nhttps://0.0.0.0:30000\rIf you used Option nine(b) (Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt): You can navigate directly to your domain. No warnings! And no need to use a port number.\nhttps://yourdomain.com\rNow you can enter your licence key and start using your server. I recommend using cyberduck as an ftp (remote file) gui. You can reuse the keys you generated for your ssh connection in there. It makes it so you can drag and drop files between the server and your computer.\nhttps://cyberduck.io/\nLike this guide?

An intuition that many have when teaching is to start at the foundation and strictly work upwards.

But then! (Go tobann!)\nThe common approach to teaching list iteration is some shit in C like:\nfor ( int i = 0; i \u0026lt; itemsSize; i += 1 ) { printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;, items[i]); } Which, when you factor in the detritus needed to even set this up\u0026hellip;\nint items[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; int itemsSize = sizeof(items) / sizeof(items[0]); \u0026hellip; quickly turns in to quite a few things to remember for a new programmer. Remember as you read this that for new programmers even the decision to use [] vs {} is new info to be juggled and managed. They are remembering things about the sizes of items in arrays, and the return value of sizeof, and\u0026hellip; what type was that again? What\u0026rsquo;s a type?\nBut this all makes the teacher feel oh so correct. It feels like the path is right. It feels like by taking this approach, one step at a time, they are truly elevating the student. They\u0026rsquo;re being true to them and true to the fundamental realities of the world behind the code.\nHowever it\u0026rsquo;s little more than littering.\nThe goal was to teach lists and list iteration, and look at the mess we\u0026rsquo;ve made.\nSome python to save the day. items = [1, 2, 3, 4] for item in items: print(item) It practically explains its self. It gets to the core concept so quickly and precicely it\u0026rsquo;s unbelievable. The baggage involved is so minimal even ryanair won\u0026rsquo;t blink twice.\nRefer back to the simple sentence:\n\u0026ldquo;We want to transverse a list of items in sequence, printing the value of each element as you go\u0026rdquo;.\nThere it is in code. The student has truly learned something.\nThey can digest the whole concept in one bite.\nThere are of course other languages that are expressive like this, or even in their own uniquely lovely ways. But I mean come on. It\u0026rsquo;s python.\nAnd there are of course other areas this idea applies to. Do you need to know about elastic modulus to swap your steel tool for a carbide one?

First thing you\u0026rsquo;d do is design a blueprint. In Python, writing a class is much like writing a blueprint for something. Let\u0026rsquo;s write our widget!\nclass Widget: pass Well. That was easy. We could start producing these widgets right away if we liked.\nfirst_edition_widget = Widget() second_edition_widget = Widget() third_edition_widget = Widget() Nice! We have our widgets. Each widget is an instance of Widget and is its own object. We don\u0026rsquo;t yet have a way to give our widgets a range of colours though. Giving our class an __init__ method will enable us to initialise each widget with a colour. Let\u0026rsquo;s do that, and then create a red widget.\nclass Widget: def __init__(self, colour): self.colour = colour red_widget = Widget(\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) So, generally speaking, if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this you should know that our red_widget now has a .colour attribute which can be accessed by red_widget.colour. But what is self? What is an instance? How is the red_widget instance different from the Widget class definition?\nHow about we add a what_colour method that allows widgets to tell us their colour, to illustrate what self means.\nclass Widget: def __init__(self, colour): self.colour = colour def what_colour(self): print(f\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a {self.colour} widget :)\u0026#34;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; red_widget = Widget(\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; blue_widget = Widget(\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; red_widget.what_colour() \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a red widget :)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; blue_widget.what_colour() \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a blue widget :)\u0026#34; Here we can see that an instance of a widget is able to refer to parts of its self, using self. When a widget looks up self.colour it looks up its own individual colour. We can see the blue widget is aware it is blue, and the red aware it is red. These are completely independent objects with their own ideas of self.\nJust like I can say “This is my coffee”, our widgets can say “This is my colour” — by means of the idea of self. This is true for all instances of any class.\nself refers to the instance from which self is being used.\nWhat is the self in the method signature here though: def what_colour(self):\nThis, more than anything, is a formality — a language design choice. A method needs to know which instance of a class it\u0026rsquo;s dealing with, and passing the actual instance to it is the most explicit way of doing this. Python will automatically pass self for us, but not receive it for us. This allows us to have things like @staticmethod which you can read about yourself.\nTo reiterate: why do we do:\nred_widget.what_colour() rather than\nred_widget.what_colour(red_widget) if the method needs to know what instance it\u0026rsquo;s working with?\nWell — we could do the latter if we wanted! We can demonstrate how self is the exact same as red_widget in the following example:\nclass Widget: def __init__(self, colour): self.colour = colour def what_colour(self, pretend_self): print(f\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a {pretend_self.colour} widget :)\u0026#34;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; red_widget = Widget(\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; red_widget.what_colour(red_widget) \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a red widget :)\u0026#34; This time, we never used self at all! self was passed as the first argument to .what_colour by Python, and then we passed our instance of the red widget to its self, and used that in place of the automatically passed one. There was absolutely no difference in terms of functionality from the last time we ran .what_colour normally.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re very clever, having been told that an instance\u0026rsquo;s method needs to be passed its self as an instance, you\u0026rsquo;re wondering why can\u0026rsquo;t it just know?\nWell, when you call a method on an instance, behind the scenes Python is really calling the instance’s class’ method and passing the instance.\nLook at this:\nclass Widget: def __init__(self, colour): self.colour = colour def what_colour(self): print(f\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a {self.colour} widget :)\u0026#34;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; red_widget = Widget(\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Widget.what_colour(red_widget) \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a red widget :)\u0026#34; ^^ That is why, when defining a class, the methods must accept an instance!\n","permalink":"https://record.theelous3.net/posts/wtf_is_self/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s say you wanted to design a useful little machine called a widget, and start producing them in a range of colours.

(Usually means getting stuff from your hard drive, or over a network.) Hard drives and networks are physical things which need to be accessed, and as such they are extremely slow relative to running computations, or accessing things from your blazing fast RAM.\nThe performance of an i/o bound task is dependent on the devices and interfaces between you and the resource you want to access. This could be kilometers of copper wire maintained by pigeons, or it could be your uber-fast SSD.\nCpu bound Cpu bound operations are operations that are difficult to compute. Not difficult in terms of complexity, but in terms of time and effort required by your cpu to complete the operation.\nEvery operation uses some cpu, but for the most part they take such a short time that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to be considered. If your task\u0026rsquo;s performance is dominated by the performance of your cpu, and the task isn\u0026rsquo;t performing as well as you\u0026rsquo;d like, then the task is cpu bound.\nCalculating large Fibonacci numbers is the ye olde example of a cpu bound task. The performance of a cpu bound task is dependent on the performance of… your cpu!\nBlocking This one can be tricky for new people. What does it mean for something to be \u0026ldquo;blocking\u0026rdquo;?\nComputer programs at their most basic (one process, one thread) can only do one thing at a time. Be that some simple addition (1+1) or an abstraction of many operations, like running a function.\nIf you run a cpu bound function that takes a long time, you can consider it \u0026ldquo;blocking\u0026rdquo; in that it\u0026rsquo;s taking so long it\u0026rsquo;s stopping other tasks from running and slowing the desired speed of the program.\nLikewise, if you send a request to a website, you have to wait on the response before you proceed to use the response data. Here your program is \u0026ldquo;blocking\u0026rdquo; on network i/o, doing nothing but waiting.\nParallelism Tasks running under parallelism can do work at the same time, in the most literal sense. This is why having multiple cores in a cpu is useful. If one is busy, another can simultaneously do work.\nConcurrency Concurrent tasks are tasks that are active at the same time. They do not necessarily have to be able to do work at the same time. Concurrent tasks can start, run and end during the running of other tasks they are concurrent with. For the purposes of this page, we will say concurrency does not involve parallelism.\nIn this fashion, humans are concurrent creatures. Were you to make coffee and a sandwich, you might start the coffee task by boiling some water. While you wait you can start and finish the sandwich task; coming back to the coffee task when the rest of the brewing process is ready to continue.\nCoroutine A coroutine is a function or method which can yield control during its operation back to its caller, remaining in a suspended state until resumed.\nEvent loop An event loop is some code that controls the starting, running and scheduling of other code (usually coroutines) over a program\u0026rsquo;s lifetime. To put it in the words of a friend \u0026ldquo;well, an event loop is something that handles events in a loop\u0026rdquo;. Obvious, redundant, yet still worth thinking about.\nNote: it is a coroutine that decides when to give control back to an event loop. This is different to threading in that thread execution is decided entirely by the thing managing the threads (usually your operating system).\nThe Methods of Doing Multiple Things at Once Threading Threading is good for solving i/o blocking. It is the most common way of adding concurrency to python programs.\nA python program by default has a main thread which runs synchronously, meaning it just runs operations as it needs, one at a time. When you create a new thread, you are creating another thread that runs concurrently with all other threads in the process.\nThe main python thread, and any new threads we make, all run in the same process. A thread cannot do anything if another thread is doing something, and so on. It is a common misunderstanding to think threading adds parallelism.\nBecause waiting on i/o blocking is pretty much just sitting idle until the i/o access is ready, it\u0026rsquo;s ok to leave one thread waiting on i/o and do cpu bound work in another, coming back to the thread waiting on i/o later.\nIt is very important to note that threads may switch at any time, as governed by your operating system. You cannot rely on threads to switch at any particular place. Threading can create race conditions.\nBecause cpu bound work is also in a sense \u0026ldquo;blocking\u0026rdquo;, doing cpu bound work in two threads simply means switching to and fro between these threads, with no gain in overall speed whatsoever. (In fact, the small overhead of working with threads makes it slightly slower!)\nMultiprocessing Multiprocessing is good for bringing parallelism to cpu bound tasks. Multiprocessing can also solve i/o blocking, but because the overhead of creating and communicating between processes is so much greater than with other methods it is pretty much always faster to use something else to solve i/o blocking.\nMultiprocessing is best used when you need to parallelise cpu bound tasks where even with the added overhead, you save time compared to running the same tasks in one process. How do you know when it\u0026rsquo;s worth it? Well, from experience and (more importantly) testing!\nSay you have to calculate something that takes 10 seconds per run, twice. In a single process, this will take 20 seconds. In two it will take 10 seconds + the overhead of multiprocessing. Even if you were passing giant blocks of data between the processes, taking a full second, you\u0026rsquo;d still pretty much cut the time taken in half. (In reality, your time overhead from multiprocessing should be very short.)\nGenerally you want to ensure the result of the cpu bound task is as small as possible so the overhead of inter-process communication is low. Passing large objects between processes is slow and involves stuff like pickling. Yuck.\nUsing multiprocessing can (and usually will) create race conditions, which you must manage.\nAsynchronous concurrency with async / await (asyncio, curio, trio) Async is good for doing concurrent i/o. Async confuses the absolute piss out of people; however as a very general concept it\u0026rsquo;s quite simple.\nAn event loop manages tasks (coroutines), and these tasks can be paused during their operation — say, when they want to wait for a network i/o response — yielding control to the event loop, which then allows some other task to run, coming back to the task doing i/o bound work when the i/o is ready. All of this takes place in one thread.\nIt is very much like threading but rather than create new threads we create new tasks, and rather than have python\u0026rsquo;s guts manage where and when the threads yield control to other threads, the event loop manages which tasks to run and the tasks themselves decide at which points they will allow control to be yielded to the event loop.\nA nice side effect of this single threaded concurrency is that it is much harder to create race conditions. The overhead of running an event loop is also usually lower than that of running multiple threads, so pound for pound async is faster than threading. These methods excel at extremely high levels of concurrency.\nThere are libraries like Twisted that are in some ways very similar to asyncio, requiring managing things like futures and so on. There is nothing wrong with them, but you probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like to use them :)\nAsynchronous concurrency by means of incantation (Eventlet, gevent \u0026amp; co) These are basically magic for doing concurrent i/o, built before python had async/await. They are complete voodoo and were created by a group of mimes from the Himalayas during a night of fever dreams. Work bloody great though.\nThey are as battle-tested as any of them, and though they require some unique mechanics to work, generally speaking the resulting code is quite clean and manageable, perhaps even more so than any other method here.\nInternally their workings are extremely similar to the previously mentioned async/await style async, but like I said, it\u0026rsquo;s voodoo.\n","permalink":"https://record.theelous3.net/posts/python_concurrency_primer/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"some-terminology\"\u003eSome Terminology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"io\"\u003eI/O\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ei/o (input/output) is pretty much any operation that requires getting data from outside of your computer’s RAM.
